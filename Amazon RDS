Amazon RDS-managed database service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud.
DB instance-isolated database enviornment that runs in the cloud
Because RDS is a fully managed service, one task that it automatically performs is the periodic backup on a DB instance
The first snapshot of a DB instance contains the full data. 
Subsequent snapshots are incremental and contain only the data that changed since the most recent snapshot.
When creating a database in AWS, it may take up to 20 min to create
Amazon RDS can be highly available by using Multi-AZ deployment. This config automatically generates a standby copy of the database instance in another Availability Zone in the same VPC
Amazon RDS scaling options: Instance class and storage capacity
