DynamoDB -fully managed, serverless, key-value No SQl database
5 benefits: Scalability, Redundancy, Recoverability, Low latency, Security and Flexibility
DynamoDB-table name and primary key must be specified at table creation
DynamoDB table has at least one column that acts as teh primary key

The primary key is the only data that is required when storing a row in a DynamoDB table. Any other data is optional

A column in a DynamoDB table is called an attribute. An attribute is something that does not need to be broken down any further

Primary keys can consist of one or two atrributes

an item is a group of attributes that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items. Items are like rows

Simple primary key-consists of one attribute. The attribute is called the partition key or hsh key

Composite primary key consists of two attributes. First attribute is partition key, second attribute is the sort key or range attribute

DynamoDB tables store item data in partitions

Table data is partitioned and indexed by the primary key

Tables whose data is distributed evenly across multiple partitions generally deliver the best performance

Data can be pulled from multiple partitons depending on teh value for the primary key 

Results from queries can have different length (additional attributes)

Using the global table option creates a DynamoDB table that is automatically replicated across your choice of AWS Regions worldwide

A global table is a collection of one or more DynamoDB tables, which must all be owned by a single AWS account
