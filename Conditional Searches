Three types of operators are Arithmetic, Comparison, and Logical

SELECT lifeexpectancy, lifeexpectancy+5.5
FROM country
WHERE gnp > 130000

Adds 5.5 years to each lifeexpectancy value

SELECT population, population-350000
FROM country
WHERE name = 'United States'

The arithmetic operator subtracts 350,000 from the population value

SELECT population, population*1.15
FROM country
WHERE name = 'Malta'

The arithmetic operator increases the population by 15 percent


SELECT  population, surfacearea, population/surfacearea
FROM country
WHERE population/surfacearea > 3000

The airthmetic operator divices the population by surfacearea


SELECT population, surfacearea, population/surfacearea, population%surfacearea
FROM country
WHERE name = 'San Marino'

Calculates and displays the remainder of the population divided by the surfacearea

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city
WHERE countrycode = 'IND'
AND district = 'Delhi'

Query return data items for cities in IND and whose district is called Delhi

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE district = 'Delhi' OR district = 'Punjab

Query return data items for cities with districts called Delhi or Punjab

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE district IN ('Delhi','Punjab','Kerala')

Query return data items for cities with districts called Delhi, Punjab, and Kerala

SELECT name, district, population
FROM city 
WHERE district LIKE 'West%'

Query return data items for cities whose district names start with the name West

SELECT countrycode, name 
FROM city 
WHERE countrycode LIKE '_B_'

Query return data items for cities whose country code has the letter B as second character of the three-character code

SELECT countrycode, name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE population BETWEEN 500000 AND 505000

Query return data items for cities whose populations are between 500,000 and 505,000 people

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE countrycode = 'CAN' AND district NOT IN ('Ontario','Alberta')

Query return data items for cities in Canada except those in Ontario and Alberta


SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'CAN' 
AND district <> 'Ontario' 
AND district <> 'Alberta'

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE countrycode = 'CAN' 
AND district NOT IN ('Ontario','Alberta')

Both achieve the same results by using different SQL statements

SELECT name, district, population 
FROM city 
WHERE countrycode = 'PAK' 
AND (district = 'Punjab' OR district = 'Sindh') 
AND population > 1500000

The parentheses help further define expected query results


SELECT name, lifeexpectancy, lifeexpectancy+5.5 AS newlifeexpectancy 
FROM country 
WHERE gnp > 1300000

Query lists the new life expectancy for these countries, with the alias newlifeexpectancy used for the column name in the query output

SELECT name, lifeexpectancy, lifeexpectancy+5.5 AS 'new life expectancy' 
FROM country 
WHERE gnp > 130000

Query lists the new life expectancy for these countries, with the resulting alias new life expectancy (with spaces) used for the column name in the query output

SELECT name, lifeexpectancy 
FROM country 
WHERE lifeexpectancy IS NULL 
AND name NOT LIKE '%Island%';

Query lists countries with no data for life expectancy will have null values.
